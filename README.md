This GitHub repository contains a machine learning model for predicting house prices in Bengaluru, India. Predicting house prices is a crucial task in the real estate market, and this project aims to provide insights into the factors that influence house prices in Bengaluru and create an accurate prediction model.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started with this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python
- scikit-learn/sklearn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter/Spyder/Pycharm (or any Python IDE of your choice)

## Project Overview

The main steps involved in this project are as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on house prices in Bengaluru. This dataset typically contains information about various features of houses (independent variables) and their corresponding prices (dependent variable).

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and dealing with outliers.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between independent variables and house prices. Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn can be used to create meaningful plots and graphs.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Extract the dependent variable (house prices) and independent variables (features) from the dataset. This step may involve creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the model's performance.

5. **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Additionally, it's important to handle skewed data using techniques like stratified shuffle split from the scikit-learn library to ensure a representative distribution of data in both sets.

6. **Model Building**: Develop a machine learning model for house price prediction. Common algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, or random forests can be used. Hyperparameter tuning techniques can be applied to increase the accuracy of the prediction.

7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared. This step helps in assessing how well the model is performing and if any further improvements are needed.

8. **Deployment**: Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed in a real-world application for predicting house prices in Bengaluru.
